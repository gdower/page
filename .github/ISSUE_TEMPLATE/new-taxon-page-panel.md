* Need help filling this out?  Once you have your panel details in hand, contact us and we'll help step you through filling out this issue.
* While filling out the template you can delete instructions in the issue that you've finished reading.  Instructions are italicized text, these are wrapped in underscores (_).

## Summary (required):
To understand what you want, as a way to organize and prioritize what we build, please provide the following: 
  
_As an X I need Y to answer question Q for audience A._

```
X - Who are you, i.e. in what role are you presenting this panel?
Y - What do you need to answer the questions that this panel addresses, a graph, table, map, text?
Q - What is your question, phrase it for the intended audience(s)?
A - Who is the target audience of the answers in this panel?
```

## Details, that is what is Y, this panel
### X 
_Anything particularly important that we should know to understand about who you are?_

### Q
_Expand on your question, why does this panel provide an adequate answer to A?_
  
### A
_More on your audience. How does this panel specifically answer Q to a group of school kids/professional taxonomists/undergrads/ecologist/border security specialist?_

### Interface
#### Suggested primary header (title of panel if present)
e.g. "Type species"
#### Napkin sketch (minimal visual description of panel, can add many iterations)
Drag/drop an image to your cursor to add an image file.
#### Wireframe or mockup (mocked digital description of the panel, can include screenshots)
Drag/drop an image to your cursor to add an image file.
  
### Actions - what can the user do with this panel that is "unique" to this panel?
For example: Click to sort columns, click to apply a filter, click to expand an element to show more information?
  
## Data (required, work with the technical team to define this)
_What is the corresponding data-object that is accessible to the end user (e.g. CSV, JSON, GeoJSON, NeXML etc.) in this panel?_

## Citation
_What does a citation to the data look like for this section?_ 
(TODO: Examples should flow from taxonworks.csl)
  
## Technical details (TODO: turn into table?)
_Largely completed by developers._

### Metadata
* General data source (e.g. TaxonWorks, ALA, GBIF, CoL, Globi)
* API entry point or offline data-source?
* Suitable for offline?
* Suitable for print?
* GH pages deployable?
* Proximity map (What should be rendered close to this panel)
* Dependent panels (minimize/eliminate these if possible)? (Reference by issue.)
* Panel source code repository
